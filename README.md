# MyFate

**MyFate** is a student-first academic decision clarity platform designed to help learners understand the real consequences of academic choices *before* those consequences happen. Instead of guessing how a missed deadline, late penalty, or high-weight assignment might affect their future, **MyFate** provides a clear, transparent, and fully manual way to model outcomes and plan ahead.

---

## 🌱 Overview

**MyFate** empowers students to make informed academic decisions using deterministic, rule-based logic — no AI, no hidden algorithms, and no external APIs. Every result is explainable, predictable, and rooted in the information students already know about their courses.

The platform focuses on clarity over complexity, shipping real value rather than abstract predictions.

## 🧮 Assignment Impact Analysis

At its core, **MyFate** allows students to analyze how individual assignments affect their overall course performance.

Students manually input:
- Course and subject (searchable dropdowns)
- Assignment type (exam, project, homework, midterm, final, etc.)
- Assignment weight in the course
- Due date and late policy
- Expected performance range

**MyFate** then calculates:
- The relative importance of the assignment
- The impact of late penalties
- Risk level (low, moderate, high)

Results are presented in a clear, readable format designed to support real decision-making.

## 🧠 Fully Manual & Transparent (No AI)

**MyFate** intentionally avoids AI and external APIs.

- All inputs are manual
- All logic is deterministic
- All outcomes are explainable

This ensures:
- Privacy and reliability
- No API costs or keys
- No black-box decision making

Students always know *why* a result appears.

## 🤝 Study Partner Matching (Free)

The **Study Partners** feature helps students improve outcomes through collaboration.

Users can match with others based on:
- Subject or course overlap
- Shared availability
- Preferred study style (quiet, collaborative, accountability)

Matches are shown as simple profile cards with:
- Course context
- Available time windows
- Study preferences

This feature is fully free and designed to encourage healthy academic collaboration.

---

## 🕒 Office Hours Alignment

The **Office Hours** feature helps students access academic support more effectively.

Students can:
- Enter instructor office hour times
- Input their own availability
- Instantly see overlap and conflicts

Results are labeled clearly:
- Good fit
- Partial overlap
- Unavailable

This removes friction from seeking help and encourages proactive engagement.

---

## 🧭 Degree Timeline Awareness

**MyFate** places individual assignments and courses into a broader academic context.

The **Degree Timeline** view shows:
- Where a course sits in the student’s progression
- Whether it is a prerequisite, core requirement, or elective
- Potential downstream effects of poor performance or failure

This helps students understand long-term consequences beyond a single semester.

---

## 💾 Saved Analyses & Comparison Mode (Pro)

Pro users can:
- Save past assignment analyses
- Compare multiple scenarios side-by-side
- Evaluate tradeoffs between different decisions

This transforms **MyFate** from a one-time calculator into a long-term planning tool.

---

## 📊 Pattern Insights (Pro)

Without using AI, **MyFate** surfaces rule-based insights such as:
- Workload clustering
- Repeated high-risk assignments
- Consistent grade loss from late penalties

These insights help students adjust habits over time.

---

## 📤 Export & Share

Students can export clean summaries of analyses to:
- Share with academic advisors
- Discuss with tutors
- Coordinate with study partners

This bridges the gap between planning and real-world action.

## ⚖️ Ethical Monetization

**MyFate** is designed with fairness in mind:
- Core learning tools remain free
- Monetization focuses on planning depth, not access to help
- No essential academic support features are paywalled

## 🎨 Thoughtful User Experience

**MyFate** emphasizes focus and calm:
- Clean layouts
- Clear sections
